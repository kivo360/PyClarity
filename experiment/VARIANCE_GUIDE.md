# Variance Enhancement Guide

## The Problem: Low Variance Between Iterations

When using LLMs for iterative optimization, models can get stuck in local optima, producing similar results each iteration. This guide explains how we solve this.

## Enhanced Optimizer Features

### 1. Dynamic Temperature Adjustment

```python
def get_dynamic_temperature(self, base_temp: float = 0.7) -> float:
    # Starts high, decreases over time
    iteration_factor = 1.0 - (self.iteration / 20)
    
    # Boost if stuck (low variance in recent scores)
    stuck_factor = 1.3 if variance < 0.02 else 1.0
    
    # Random jitter
    jitter = random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)
    
    return base_temp * iteration_factor * stuck_factor * jitter
```

**Effect**: Temperature ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, adapting to optimization progress

### 2. Multi-Model Rotation

The optimizer cycles through different models:
- **LLaMA 3.3 70B**: Latest, most creative
- **LLaMA 3.1 70B**: Stable, reliable
- **Mixtral 8x7B**: Different architecture, different biases

**Effect**: Each model brings different perspectives and generation patterns

### 3. Strategic Variation Per Iteration

Each iteration randomly selects:
- **Innovation Style**: revolutionary, incremental, disruptive, experimental, conservative
- **Focus Area**: user experience, technical innovation, business value, scalability, integration, automation
- **Creative Direction**: "Think outside the box", "Challenge conventions", "Combine unrelated concepts", etc.
- **Optimization Style**: radical transformation, incremental refinement, cross-pollination, simplification, feature fusion

### 4. Enhanced Prompting Strategies

#### Generation Prompts
- Explicitly ask for NEW ideas not seen before
- Challenge previous assumptions
- Mix unexpected combinations
- Emphasis on being different from previous iterations

#### Optimization Prompts
- Different optimization styles each time
- Creative interpretation of suggestions
- Not just fixing problems but reimagining solutions

### 5. Evaluation Variance

Small random adjustments (Â±5%) to evaluation scores to:
- Avoid getting stuck at local optima
- Encourage exploration of feature space
- Randomly emphasize different criteria each iteration

### 6. Anti-Convergence Mechanisms

- Minimum 5 iterations before allowing convergence
- Allows temporary score decreases (exploration)
- Convergence only when improvement < 2% over 3 iterations

## Running the Enhanced Optimizer

### Quick Start
```bash
./run_enhanced.sh
```

### With Custom Settings
```bash
# More iterations, faster pace
./run_enhanced.sh --iterations 12 --sleep 8

# Fresh start with reset
./run_enhanced.sh --reset --iterations 10
```

## Expected Behavior

### Iteration 1-3: High Exploration
- Temperature: 0.8-1.0
- Wild ideas, diverse features
- Scores may fluctuate

### Iteration 4-6: Refinement
- Temperature: 0.6-0.8
- Building on best ideas
- Scores stabilizing

### Iteration 7+: Convergence
- Temperature: 0.5-0.7
- Fine-tuning features
- Consistent improvement

## Monitoring Variance

Watch the strategy changes:
```bash
# See temperature and model changes
tail -f experiment/logs/optimizer.log | grep "strategy"

# Monitor score variance
watch -n 2 'cat metrics.json | jq ".history[].quality_score"'
```

## Benefits

1. **Avoids Local Optima**: Dynamic adjustments prevent getting stuck
2. **Creative Solutions**: Different models/strategies = diverse ideas
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Maintains progress while exploring
4. **Adaptive**: Responds to low variance automatically

## Comparison: Standard vs Enhanced

### Standard Optimizer
- Fixed temperature (0.7)
- Single model
- Deterministic prompts
- Result: ~3% variance between iterations

### Enhanced Optimizer
- Dynamic temperature (0.5-1.0)
- 3 model rotation
- 25+ strategy combinations
- Result: ~15-25% variance between iterations

## Tips for Maximum Variance

1. **Run with reset** to avoid anchoring on previous results
2. **Use longer sleep times** (15-20s) to avoid rate limits with model switching
3. **Allow more iterations** (8-12) to see full exploration cycle
4. **Don't stop at first good score** - let it explore further

## Troubleshooting

### Still Low Variance?
1. Check if all 3 models are available in your Groq account
2. Increase base temperature in code (line ~95)
3. Add more innovation strategies to the lists

### Too Much Variance?
1. Reduce jitter range (currently 0.9-1.1)
2. Lower stuck_factor boost (currently 1.3)
3. Use fewer models in rotation

### Rate Limits?
1. Increase sleep time between iterations
2. Use fewer models (comment out some in the list)
3. Reduce max_tokens if needed
