## BDD-First Testing Strategy

### Behavior-Driven Development → Test-Driven Development Flow

1. **BDD Scenarios First** - Write Gherkin feature files for user journeys (human + agent)
2. **Convert BDD → TDD** - Transform scenarios into pytest test cases
3. **Red-Green-Refactor** - TDD cycle driven by BDD acceptance criteria
4. **Schema Generation** - Database design emerges from test requirements
5. **Interface Definition** - User/agent interactions defined by test scenarios

### BDD Feature Coverage

**Human Consumer Journeys**
```gherkin
Feature: Complete Product Discovery Workflow
  Scenario: Entrepreneur discovers market opportunity
    Given I provide a basic product idea
    When I execute the full discovery pipeline  
    Then I receive comprehensive market analysis
    And I get competitive positioning recommendations
    And I obtain validated feature priorities
    And I receive BDD acceptance criteria for implementation

Feature: Cognitive Workflow Orchestration
  Scenario: Product manager chains cognitive tools
    Given I need multi-perspective product analysis
    When I configure a workflow with Sequential Thinking + Mental Models + Decision Framework
    Then The tools execute in dependency order
    And Results flow seamlessly between cognitive analyzers
    And I receive synthesized insights from all perspectives
```

**Agent Consumer Journeys**
```gherkin
Feature: Agent-to-Agent Workflow Integration
  Scenario: AI agent requests competitive intelligence
    Given An AI agent needs market positioning data
    When The agent calls the competitive analysis API
    Then The agent receives structured JSON response
    And The response includes confidence scores and source attribution
    And The data format matches the agent's schema expectations

Feature: Automated BDD Generation for Agents
  Scenario: Development agent generates acceptance criteria
    Given An agent has validated product features
    When The agent requests BDD acceptance criteria generation
    Then The agent receives properly formatted Gherkin scenarios
    And The scenarios include both human and agent test cases
    And The criteria can be directly converted to TDD tests
```

### BDD-to-TDD Conversion Strategy

**Step 1: BDD Scenario Analysis**
- Parse Gherkin scenarios to identify required system behaviors
- Extract data requirements from Given/When/Then clauses
- Identify API contracts from agent interaction scenarios

**Step 2: TDD Test Generation**
- Convert each BDD scenario to pytest test case
- Create test fixtures for scenario data requirements
- Implement mocks for external dependencies identified in BDD

**Step 3: Schema and Interface Derivation**
- Generate Pydantic models from test data requirements
- Define API endpoints from agent interaction test cases  
- Create database schemas from data persistence test needs
