# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-04-product-discovery-workflows/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-04
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Workflow Engine Architecture
- **Async execution support** for parallel cognitive tool processing using asyncio
- **Dependency resolution system** that can determine tool execution order based on input/output requirements
- **State management** for workflow progress tracking and intermediate result storage
- **Error handling and recovery** with graceful degradation when individual tools fail
- **Configuration-driven workflows** using YAML or JSON workflow definitions

### Cognitive Tool Integration
- **Tool registry system** for dynamic discovery of available cognitive analyzers
- **Standardized tool interface** extending existing CognitiveToolBase with workflow-specific methods
- **Result serialization** using Pydantic models for consistent data flow between tools
- **Tool chaining protocol** that allows output of one tool to become input for another
- **Parallel execution support** for independent cognitive analyses

### Product Discovery Components
- **Market analysis engine** using existing persona generation and analysis capabilities
- **Competitive intelligence framework** leveraging web scraping and data analysis tools
- **Feature validation system** integrating with impact propagation and decision framework tools
- **USP generation pipeline** using comparative analysis and differentiation algorithms
- **BDD generator** creating acceptance criteria from validated features and user stories

### Performance and Scalability
- **Caching layer** for expensive operations like market research and competitive analysis
- **Rate limiting** for external API calls to prevent quota exhaustion
- **Progress tracking** with real-time status updates for long-running workflows
- **Resource management** to prevent memory leaks during complex analysis chains

## Approach Options

**Option A: Extend Existing Tools**
- Pros: Leverages existing 17 cognitive tools, faster initial development, proven patterns
- Cons: May constrain workflow flexibility, requires retrofitting existing tools

**Option B: Build Separate Workflow Engine** (Selected)
- Pros: Clean separation of concerns, optimized for workflow orchestration, easier testing
- Cons: More initial development, potential duplication of cognitive patterns

**Option C: Integration-First Approach**
- Pros: Immediate integration with external tools and services
- Cons: Increases complexity, external dependencies, harder to test

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best foundation for scalable workflow orchestration while preserving the integrity of existing cognitive tools. The separation allows for specialized optimization of workflow logic without impacting core analytical capabilities.

## Architecture Design

### Core Components

```python
# Workflow Engine Core
class WorkflowEngine:
    - async execute_workflow(workflow_definition: WorkflowConfig) -> WorkflowResult
    - resolve_dependencies(tools: List[CognitiveTool]) -> ExecutionPlan
    - manage_state(workflow_id: str, state: WorkflowState) -> None

# Tool Orchestration
class ToolOrchestrator:
    - async execute_parallel(tools: List[CognitiveTool]) -> List[ToolResult]
    - async execute_sequential(tools: List[CognitiveTool]) -> List[ToolResult]
    - handle_tool_failure(tool: CognitiveTool, error: Exception) -> FailureStrategy

# Product Discovery Pipeline
class ProductDiscoveryPipeline:
    - async analyze_market(product_idea: ProductConcept) -> MarketAnalysis
    - async research_competitors(market_analysis: MarketAnalysis) -> CompetitiveIntelligence
    - async validate_features(ideas: List[FeatureIdea]) -> FeatureValidation
    - async generate_usp(competitive_intel: CompetitiveIntelligence) -> UniqueValueProposition
```

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Input Processing**: ProductConcept → WorkflowConfig
2. **Tool Selection**: WorkflowConfig → ExecutionPlan
3. **Parallel Analysis**: Market Research + Competitive Analysis + User Research
4. **Sequential Refinement**: Feature Validation → USP Development → BDD Generation
5. **Result Synthesis**: Individual Results → Comprehensive Product Strategy

### Integration Points

- **Existing Cognitive Tools**: Sequential Thinking, Mental Models, Decision Framework, Impact Propagation
- **Persona System**: Integration with existing persona generation and analysis capabilities
- **FastMCP Server**: Expose workflows as MCP tools for external client access
- **CLI Interface**: Extend existing CLI with workflow execution commands

## External Dependencies

### Core Workflow Dependencies
- **NetworkX v3.0+** - Graph algorithms for dependency resolution and workflow optimization
- **asyncio + uvloop** - High-performance async execution for parallel tool processing
- **pydantic v2.11.7+** - Enhanced data validation for complex workflow configurations

### Product Discovery Specific
- **aiohttp v3.9.0+** - Async HTTP client for competitive research and market data gathering
- **beautifulsoup4 v4.12.0+** - Web scraping for competitive analysis (if needed)
- **jinja2 v3.1.0+** - Template engine for BDD acceptance criteria generation

### Optional Performance Enhancements
- **redis-py v5.0.0+** - Caching layer for expensive analysis results
- **celery v5.3.0+** - Task queue for long-running workflow execution (future consideration)

**Justification for New Dependencies:**
- **NetworkX**: Required for sophisticated dependency resolution in complex workflows
- **aiohttp**: Enables high-performance async data gathering for competitive analysis
- **Jinja2**: Provides flexible templating for generating standardized BDD outputs
- **Redis**: Optional but valuable for caching expensive market research results

## BDD-First Implementation Strategy

### Development Flow: User Journey → BDD → TDD → Implementation

```
User Journey Stories
      ↓
BDD Acceptance Criteria (Human & Agent Consumers)
      ↓
TDD Implementation Tests
      ↓
Database Schemas & Data Models
      ↓
User Interactions & Agent Interfaces
      ↓
Deployment Pipelines & Integration Points
```

### Phase 1: BDD Foundation (Week 1)
**BDD-First Approach:**
- Write BDD scenarios for complete user journeys (human + agent consumers)
- Define acceptance criteria for both human users and AI agent interactions
- Create Gherkin feature files for all workflow scenarios
- Establish behavior verification before any implementation

**Key BDD Scenarios:**
```gherkin
Feature: Product Discovery for Human Users
  Scenario: Solo entrepreneur validates product idea
    Given I have a basic product concept
    When I execute the discovery workflow
    Then I receive market analysis, competitive intelligence, and USP recommendations
    And I can convert findings to BDD acceptance criteria

Feature: Product Discovery for Agent Consumers  
  Scenario: AI agent requests competitive analysis
    Given An agent needs competitive positioning data
    When The agent calls the competitive intelligence API
    Then The agent receives structured analysis in expected format
    And The response includes confidence scores and data sources
```

### Phase 2: TDD Implementation (Week 1-2)
**Convert BDD → TDD:**
- Transform BDD scenarios into pytest test cases
- Implement WorkflowEngine with TDD red-green-refactor cycles
- Create ToolOrchestrator following TDD principles
- Build test-driven data models and API interfaces

### Phase 3: Schema & Interface Design (Week 2)
**From TDD to Implementation:**
- Design database schemas based on test requirements
- Create user interaction patterns (CLI, API, MCP interfaces)
- Define agent interaction protocols (structured APIs, event streams)
- Implement data persistence layer driven by test specifications

### Phase 4: Integration & Deployment (Week 2-3)
**End-to-End Integration:**
- Build deployment pipelines supporting both human and agent consumers
- Create integration tests for human workflows and agent interactions
- Implement monitoring for both user experience and agent performance
- Establish feedback loops from both consumer types
