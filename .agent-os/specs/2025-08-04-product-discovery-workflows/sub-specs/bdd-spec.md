## Core Principle: Agents as Consumers

**Philosophy:** AI agents are consumers just like humans - they have needs, consume APIs, and require reliable interfaces. Design for both consumer types from the beginning.

**Human Consumers:**
- Need intuitive interfaces, progress updates, readable reports
- Interact through CLI, future web UI, conversational interfaces
- Want flexibility, customization, and explanatory information

**Agent Consumers:**
- Need structured APIs, predictable schemas, efficient processing
- Interact through MCP protocol, REST APIs, event streams  
- Want reliability, performance, and clear capability discovery

## BDD Feature Files

### Feature 1: Complete Product Discovery for Humans

```gherkin
Feature: End-to-End Product Discovery Workflow
  As a solo entrepreneur
  I want to validate my product idea through comprehensive analysis
  So that I can make informed decisions about market entry and positioning

  Background:
    Given PyClarity discovery workflows are available
    And I have access to cognitive reasoning tools
    And External market data sources are accessible

  Scenario: Basic Product Concept to Market Validation
    Given I have a product concept "AI-powered fitness app for busy professionals"
    When I execute the product discovery workflow
    Then I receive a market analysis report within 5 minutes
    And The report includes market size, growth trends, and opportunity assessment
    And I get competitive intelligence on 5-10 similar products
    And Each competitor analysis includes positioning, features, and differentiation gaps
    And I receive 3-5 validated feature recommendations with priority scores
    And The output includes unique value proposition suggestions
    And I can export findings as BDD acceptance criteria for development

  Scenario: Cognitive Tool Chaining for Multi-Perspective Analysis
    Given I need comprehensive product analysis
    When I configure a workflow with Sequential Thinking → Mental Models → Decision Framework
    Then Sequential Thinking breaks down the problem into logical steps
    And Mental Models applies different cognitive frameworks to each step
    And Decision Framework evaluates options using weighted criteria
    And Results flow seamlessly between tools without data loss
    And I receive synthesized insights incorporating all cognitive perspectives
    And The final output shows reasoning chains and confidence scores

  Scenario: BDD Generation from Validated Features
    Given I have completed product discovery with validated features
    When I request BDD acceptance criteria generation
    Then I receive properly formatted Gherkin scenarios for each feature
    And Each scenario includes human user interactions
    And Each scenario includes agent consumer interactions
    And The criteria cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
    And The output can be directly imported into pytest for TDD implementation
```

### Feature 2: Agent-to-Agent Workflow Integration

```gherkin
Feature: AI Agent Workflow Consumption
  As an AI development agent
  I want to consume product discovery workflows through structured APIs
  So that I can integrate market intelligence into automated development processes

  Background:
    Given PyClarity MCP server is running
    And Agent authentication is configured
    And Workflow APIs are available

  Scenario: Agent Requests Competitive Analysis
    Given An AI agent needs competitive positioning data for "productivity software"
    When The agent calls the competitive-intelligence MCP tool
    And Provides structured input: {"domain": "productivity", "target_market": "remote_workers"}
    Then The agent receives JSON response within 10 seconds
    And Response includes confidence scores for each competitor
    And Response includes structured feature comparisons
    And Response includes market positioning data
    And Response matches expected schema validation
    And The agent can programmatically process all returned data

  Scenario: Agent Chains Multiple Cognitive Tools
    Given An agent needs multi-step product validation
    When The agent requests workflow: market-analysis → feature-validation → usp-generation
    And Provides configuration for parallel vs sequential execution
    Then Workflow engine resolves tool dependencies automatically
    And Each tool receives properly formatted input from previous tool
    And Agent receives progress updates through callback mechanisms
    And Final output includes traceability of reasoning chains
    And Error states are clearly communicated with recovery options

  Scenario: Agent Generates BDD for Development Team
    Given An agent has completed product discovery
    When The agent requests BDD scenario generation for development handoff
    Then The agent receives Gherkin files for human developers
    And The agent receives API specifications for other agents
    And Each scenario includes both human and agent test cases
    And Output includes implementation hints and technical considerations
    And Generated BDD can be automatically committed to development repository
```

### Feature 3: Database Schema Evolution

```gherkin
Feature: Data Persistence Driven by User Behavior
  As a system architect
  I want database schemas that emerge from actual usage patterns
  So that data storage optimizes for real workflow requirements

  Scenario: Schema Generation from BDD Requirements
    Given BDD scenarios define data requirements
    When I analyze Given/When/Then clauses for data entities
    Then Pydantic models are generated for each identified entity
    And Database migrations are created from model definitions
    And Schemas support both human and agent data access patterns
    And Indexes are optimized for common query patterns from test scenarios

  Scenario: API Contract Definition from Agent Interactions
    Given Agent consumption scenarios specify data exchanges
    When I extract API requirements from agent BDD scenarios
    Then OpenAPI specifications are generated automatically
    And MCP tool definitions match agent interaction patterns
    And Response schemas include all data elements used in test scenarios
    And Error response formats cover all failure modes in BDD scenarios
```

## BDD Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Scenario Writing (Week 1, Days 1-2)
1. **User Journey Mapping**: Document complete user flows for human + agent consumers
2. **Gherkin Feature Creation**: Write comprehensive BDD scenarios covering all use cases
3. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**: Establish measurable outcomes for each scenario
4. **Stakeholder Review**: Validate scenarios with both human users and agent developers

### Phase 2: BDD-to-TDD Conversion (Week 1, Days 3-5)
1. **Scenario Analysis**: Parse Gherkin to extract technical requirements
2. **Test Case Generation**: Convert each scenario to pytest test cases
3. **Mock Definition**: Create mocks for external dependencies identified in scenarios
4. **Data Fixture Creation**: Build test data based on scenario examples

### Phase 3: Schema and Interface Emergence (Week 2, Days 1-3)
1. **Data Model Extraction**: Generate Pydantic models from test data requirements
2. **API Contract Definition**: Create OpenAPI specs from agent interaction patterns
3. **Database Schema Generation**: Build migrations from data model requirements
4. **MCP Tool Registration**: Define MCP tools based on agent consumption scenarios

### Phase 4: Implementation Validation (Week 2, Days 4-5)
1. **BDD Scenario Execution**: Run Gherkin scenarios against implemented system
2. **Consumer Testing**: Validate both human and agent interaction patterns
3. **Performance Verification**: Ensure timing requirements from scenarios are met
4. **Error Handling Validation**: Confirm all failure modes are properly handled

## Success Metrics

### BDD Coverage Requirements
- **100% scenario coverage**: All defined Gherkin scenarios must pass
- **Dual consumer validation**: Every feature works for both human and agent consumers
- **End-to-end traceability**: User journey → BDD → TDD → Implementation → Deployment
- **Performance compliance**: All timing requirements from scenarios are met

### Quality Gates
- **BDD scenario review**: All scenarios approved by stakeholders before implementation
- **TDD conversion verification**: Every BDD scenario has corresponding TDD tests
- **Schema validation**: Database schemas support all scenario data requirements
- **Interface compliance**: APIs match contracts derived from agent interaction scenarios

This BDD-first approach ensures that every line of code serves a real user need (human or agent) and that the system architecture emerges naturally from actual usage patterns rather than theoretical design.
