## Implementation Notes

### Cognitive Tools Usage Strategy
- **Sequential Thinking**: Break down complex product problems into logical analysis steps
- **Mental Models**: Apply different business frameworks (lean startup, jobs-to-be-done, etc.)
- **Decision Framework**: Evaluate product options using weighted criteria and trade-off analysis
- **Impact Propagation**: Trace effects of product decisions through market and user systems
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Validate ideas from customer, business, and technical viewpoints
- **Existing Persona Tools**: Leverage persona generation for user behavior modeling

### BDD Generation Strategy
- Extract concrete behaviors from cognitive analysis results
- Define both human user expectations and agent consumer requirements
- Create testable scenarios that drive schema and interface design
- Ensure generated BDD scenarios include error conditions and edge cases

### Pipeline Quality Gates
- **Cognitive Stage**: Models must show clear optimization and actionable insights
- **Business Model Stage**: Actions must have clear user value and measurable outcomes  
- **BDD Stage**: Scenarios must be complete, testable, and cover both consumer types
- **TDD Stage**: Tests must drive correct implementation and include working examples
- **Integration Stage**: End-to-end pipeline must demonstrate instant problem reasoning

### Success Criteria
- Complete product concepts can flow through entire pipeline in under 1 hour
- Generated BDD scenarios accurately reflect cognitive analysis insights
- TDD tests produce working implementations that match business model expectations
- Both human and agent consumers can successfully interact with pipeline outputs
- System demonstrates instant problem reasoning across multiple product domains
