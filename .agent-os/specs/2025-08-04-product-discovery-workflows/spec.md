> Spec: Product Discovery Workflows
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Build comprehensive product discovery and validation workflows using cognitive reasoning tools for instant problem-solving across the entire product lifecycle. This system will automate ideation, competitive analysis, feature validation, USP identification, BDD implementation, and business modeling through reusable cognitive components that adapt to any problem context.

## User Stories

### Complete Product Discovery Automation

As a **solo entrepreneur**, I want to automatically generate comprehensive product discovery analysis from a basic idea, so that I can validate market opportunities, identify competitors, and develop unique value propositions without spending weeks on manual research.

**Workflow:** Input product concept → Automated competitive analysis → Market opportunity identification → Feature validation → USP development → Business model generation → BDD acceptance criteria creation

### Cognitive Workflow Engine

As a **technical product manager**, I want to chain cognitive tools together in structured workflows, so that I can create repeatable processes for product development that guide AI reasoning through consistent patterns while adapting to different problem domains.

**Workflow:** Define workflow template → Select cognitive tools for each stage → Configure tool chaining logic → Execute workflow → Review results → Iterate based on findings

### Instant Problem Reasoning

As an **AI development team lead**, I want tools that provide instant cognitive analysis across all product domains, so that my team can maintain velocity while ensuring thorough validation and strategic thinking in every decision.

**Workflow:** Present problem → AI selects appropriate cognitive tools → Parallel analysis execution → Synthesized insights → Actionable recommendations → Integration with existing workflows

## Spec Scope

1. **Product Discovery Engine** - Automated ideation and opportunity identification using cognitive reasoning patterns
2. **Competitive Intelligence System** - Systematic competitor research, positioning analysis, and market gap identification
3. **Feature Validation Framework** - Evidence-based feature prioritization using multi-perspective analysis and impact assessment
4. **USP Development Pipeline** - Unique value proposition creation through comparative analysis and differentiation strategies
5. **BDD Implementation Generator** - Complete behavior-driven development with automated acceptance criteria creation
6. **Business Model Validator** - Revenue model analysis, pricing strategy development, and viability assessment
7. **Workflow Engine Core** - Tool chaining, dependency resolution, and cognitive orchestration system
8. **Tool Abstraction Layer** - Reusable cognitive components that adapt to diverse problem contexts

## Out of Scope

- Visual workflow editor (Phase 3 roadmap item)
- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Third-party integrations beyond core MCP functionality
- Enterprise authentication systems (Phase 5 roadmap item)
- Custom LLM fine-tuning capabilities
- Direct competitor data scraping (focus on framework, not data collection)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working product discovery workflows** that can take a basic product idea and generate comprehensive analysis including competitive positioning, feature validation, and business model recommendations
2. **Cognitive tool chaining system** that allows sequential and parallel execution of reasoning tools with proper dependency management
3. **Reusable workflow templates** for common product development scenarios (discovery, validation, development, operations) that demonstrate instant problem reasoning capabilities
4. **Integration with existing PyClarity tools** showing seamless workflow progression from idea to BDD acceptance criteria
5. **Performance benchmarks** demonstrating instant cognitive analysis across multiple product domains with measurable success metrics
