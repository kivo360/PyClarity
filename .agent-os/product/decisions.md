## 2025-08-04: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build PyClarity as an enhanced Python-based MCP server providing 17 cognitive tools for automated product discovery and development workflows, targeting product developers and entrepreneurs who need comprehensive validation and structured development processes.

### Context

The original Clear Thought MCP server demonstrated the value of cognitive tools for AI assistance but suffered from high latency and limited customization options. The JavaScript ecosystem also limited integration with data science and ML libraries. There's a clear market need for automated product development workflows that reduce the 40-60% overhead in traditional discovery and validation processes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Fork and Enhance Clear Thought**
   - Pros: Faster initial development, proven architecture
   - Cons: JavaScript limitations, technical debt, licensing concerns

2. **Build Minimal MCP Server**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, faster time to market
   - Cons: Doesn't solve core workflow problems, limited differentiation

3. **Create Standalone Tools**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, easier testing
   - Cons: No integration benefits, higher adoption friction

### Rationale

Python implementation provides access to rich ecosystem of data science, ML, and automation libraries. The 17-tool cognitive framework offers comprehensive coverage of product development needs. FastMCP enables high-performance server implementation with async support.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- 3x performance improvement over JavaScript implementation
- Full customization of activation rules and behavior
- Seamless integration with Python ML/data tools
- Comprehensive product development automation

**Negative:**
- Requires Python 3.12+ (may limit some users)
- More complex initial setup than single-purpose tools
- Higher testing burden with 17 integrated tools

## 2025-08-04: Testing Strategy Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement comprehensive testing with 80%+ coverage requirement, including unit tests for each tool, integration tests for multi-tool workflows, and end-to-end MCP server tests.

### Context

With 17 complex cognitive tools and their interactions, robust testing is critical for reliability. The user strongly emphasized TDD/BDD approaches after observing untested code generation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Testing (50% coverage)**
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: Higher bug risk, difficult maintenance

2. **100% Coverage Requirement**
   - Pros: Maximum confidence
   - Cons: Diminishing returns, slower development

### Rationale

80% coverage balances thorough testing with development velocity. Focus on critical paths and tool interactions ensures reliability where it matters most.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High confidence in tool reliability
- Easier refactoring and enhancement
- Better documentation through tests

**Negative:**
- Slower initial development
- Requires testing expertise
- Additional CI/CD complexity

## 2025-08-04: Architecture Pattern Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use compartmentalized architecture with isolated tool implementations, shared base classes, and maximum abstraction for rapid deployment across problem domains.

### Context

Need to support both current 17 tools and future expansion while maintaining clean separation of concerns. Tools should be independently testable and deployable.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Design**
   - Pros: Simpler initial implementation
   - Cons: Difficult to scale, test, and maintain

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Maximum isolation, independent scaling
   - Cons: Operational complexity, performance overhead

### Rationale

Compartmentalized monolith provides clean separation without operational overhead. Shared base classes ensure consistency while allowing tool-specific customization.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Easy to add new tools
- Independent testing possible
- Clear ownership boundaries

**Negative:**
- Requires careful interface design
- Some code duplication possible
- Need to maintain base class compatibility

## 2025-08-04: Development Workflow Decision

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt "Start Small → Validate → Expand → Scale" methodology for all development, with emphasis on incremental validation before complexity.

### Context

User strongly emphasized this approach after observing issues with complex-first implementations. This methodology has proven successful in avoiding "agent suicide patterns" and ensuring measurable progress.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Waterfall Approach**
   - Pros: Clear phases, comprehensive planning
   - Cons: Slow feedback, high failure risk

2. **Pure Agile/Scrum**
   - Pros: Regular delivery, flexibility
   - Cons: Can still attempt too much per sprint

### Rationale

Incremental approach ensures each step is validated before building on it. This reduces debugging time and increases success rate while maintaining similar overall velocity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Earlier issue detection
- Measurable progress at each step
- Higher success rate
- Easier debugging

**Negative:**
- May feel slower initially
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Some rework as understanding improves

## 2025-08-04: BDD-First Pipeline Architecture

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-04-product-discovery-workflows/
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a BDD-first development pipeline where cognitive tools explore problem space and create optimized models, which then drive BDD scenario generation for both human and agent consumers, followed by TDD implementation.

### Context

The user identified a critical insight: "From the user journey, I should have behavior-driven development tests, which I can then convert to TDD, which I can then convert into database schemas, user interactions, and pipelines. And also maybe even agent interactions." This approach treats AI agents as consumers similar to humans, requiring structured interfaces and predictable behaviors.

### Architecture Flow

```
Cognitive Tools (Space Exploration & Model Optimization)
      ↓
Business Model & Action Definition (Clear User Value)
      ↓
BDD Behavior Definition (Human + Agent Expectations)
      ↓
TDD Test Implementation (Working Examples)
      ↓
Schema & Interface Generation
```

### Rationale

- **Cognitive tools excel at exploration**: Use existing 17 tools for space exploration and model optimization before committing to implementation
- **BDD provides concrete behaviors**: Transform cognitive insights into testable behaviors and expectations
- **Agents are consumers too**: AI agents need structured APIs and predictable interfaces, just like human users but simpler
- **Test-driven architecture**: Database schemas, user interfaces, and deployment pipelines emerge from actual usage patterns

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation between exploration and implementation phases
- Every implementation decision backed by cognitive reasoning
- Dual consumer validation ensures robust API design
- Architecture emerges from real usage patterns rather than theoretical design
- Faster iteration cycles with clear quality gates

**Negative:**
- More complex initial setup with multiple pipeline stages
- Requires discipline to maintain BDD-first approach
- Additional tooling needed for BDD-to-TDD conversion
- Learning curve for team on BDD methodology
