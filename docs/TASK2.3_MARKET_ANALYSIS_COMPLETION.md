# Task 2.3 Completion: Market Analysis Workflows

## Summary

Completed implementation of market analysis workflows that leverage existing cognitive tools for comprehensive market insights.

## Implementation Details

### MarketAnalysisWorkflow
- **Location**: `src/pyclarity/workflows/market_analysis.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - 4-stage analysis pipeline: Framework → Competitive → Segmentation → Opportunities
  - Uses mental models for market structure understanding
  - Leverages decision framework for viability assessment
  - Multi-perspective analysis for competitive insights
  - Triple constraint optimization for opportunity identification

### QuickMarketAssessment
- Rapid market viability check using simplified workflow
- 30-second timeout for quick decisions
- Returns simple viable/not-viable assessment

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Subtractive Approach**: Rather than creating new tools, maximally leveraged existing cognitive tools
2. **Simplified Models**: Created lightweight Pydantic models focused on essential data
3. **Modular Stages**: Each analysis stage can be used independently
4. **Mock-Friendly**: Designed for easy testing with dependency injection

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_market_analysis.py`
- Tests all major workflows and error conditions
- Model validation tests included

## Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrates with existing WorkflowEngine
- Uses standard cognitive tools (mental_models, decision_framework, etc.)
- Compatible with ProductDiscoveryPipeline for end-to-end workflows

## Next Steps
- Task 2.4: Build competitive intelligence system (can expand on current foundation)
- Task 2.5: Feature validation using persona tools
- Task 2.6: USP generation pipeline
