# PyClarity Tool Organization Strategy

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity First**: Tool names should immediately convey their purpose
2. **Cognitive Focus**: These are thinking tools, reasoning frameworks, and mental models
3. **Practical Application**: Each tool solves specific thinking/reasoning challenges
4. **Composability**: Tools can work together to solve complex problems

## Proposed Organization

## Naming Transformation Examples

### Before → After (with rationale)

**Thinking Tools:**
- `sequential_thinking_server` → `sequential_analyzer`
  - Clearer purpose: analyzes problems sequentially
  - Removes technical suffix

- `design_patterns_server` → `pattern_recognizer`
  - Active verb shows what it does
  - More general than just "design"

**Decision Tools:**
- `decision_framework_server` → `option_evaluator`
  - Specific function: evaluates decision options
  - More descriptive

- `multi_perspective_server` → `perspective_synthesizer`
  - Shows it synthesizes multiple views
  - Action-oriented

**Mental Models:**
- `mental_model_server` → `model_switcher`
  - Emphasizes the switching capability
  - More specific function

- `visual_reasoning_server` → `visual_mapper`
  - Clearer action: maps concepts visually
  - Simpler name

**Validation Tools:**
- `iterative_validation_server` → `iterative_refiner`
  - Emphasizes refinement process
  - Broader than just validation

- `metacognitive_monitoring_server` → `quality_monitor`
  - Simpler, clearer purpose
  - Less jargony

## Key Improvements

1. **Action-Oriented Names**: Use verbs that describe what the tool does
2. **Purpose-Clear**: Anyone can understand the tool's function
3. **Category Alignment**: Tools are grouped by their primary purpose
4. **Suffix Consistency**: Use -er, -or, -izer suffixes for agents/actors

## Migration Benefits

1. **Better Discovery**: Developers can find tools by purpose
2. **Clear Mental Model**: Organization matches how people think about problems
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No need to understand MCP/server concepts
4. **Improved Composability**: Clear categories show which tools work together

## Next Steps

1. Create directory structure
2. Migrate tools with new names
3. Update imports and references
4. Create category-level documentation
5. Build tool composition examples
