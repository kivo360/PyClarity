# PyClarity Enhanced Development Rules - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhanced development rules created to address the core issue: **"I'm realizing you write code with a lot of missing references."**

## Key Files Created

### 1. Core Rules Document
**File:** `/docs/rules/enhanced-claude-rules.md`
- Comprehensive guide with 10 core rules
- Each rule includes ❌ WRONG and ✅ RIGHT examples
- Focus on incremental development and validation

### 2. Working Demonstration
**File:** `/examples/demo_enhanced_rules.py`
- Live demonstration of all rules in action
- Shows 5-stage incremental development
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- Run with: `watchexec -e py python examples/demo_enhanced_rules.py`

### 3. Quick Validation Script
**File:** `/scripts/quick_validate.py`
- Fast validation for continuous monitoring
- Runs in < 1 second for instant feedback
- Checks undefined names, imports, and syntax
- Run with: `watchexec -e py python scripts/quick_validate.py`

### 4. New File Template
**File:** `/templates/new_file_template.py`
- Pre-structured template following all rules
- Includes validation blocks and stage markers
- Ready for copy-paste when creating new files

## The 10 Core Rules

### 1. Start Small → Validate → Expand → Scale
- Maximum 10 lines before first test
- Each stage builds on previous validation
- Prevents cascade failures from bad assumptions

### 2. Reference Validation Before Implementation
- Every import tested individually
- Helpful error messages with debug hints
- Discovery patterns for unknown classes

### 3. Loguru Exception Handling Pattern
- `logger.exception(e)` in all except blocks
- Rich context with every error
- Debug suggestions for common failures

### 4. Watchexec-Optimized Test Structure
- Clear screen for fresh output
- Visual progress indicators (✅/❌)
- Timestamp for each run
- Exit codes for scripting

### 5. Progressive Implementation Pattern
- Stage 1: Minimal (2-5 minutes)
- Stage 2: One feature (5 minutes)
- Stage 3: Full implementation (10+ minutes)

### 6. Import Discovery Pattern
- Scripts to find available classes
- Regex searching for class definitions
- Module introspection utilities

### 7. Database Store Testing Pattern
- Always start with in-memory stores
- Validate basic CRUD operations first
- Only add complexity after basics work

### 8. Continuous Validation Setup
- pyrightconfig.json for type checking
- Pre-commit hooks for import validation
- Integration with development workflow

### 9. Error Context Pattern
- Include input data summaries
- Show available vs. expected keys
- Provide actionable debug steps

### 10. Development Command Reference
- Essential commands documented
- Copy-paste ready for immediate use
- Covers validation, testing, and debugging

## Practical Usage

### For New Development

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp templates/new_file_template.py src/pyclarity/tools/new_tool.py
   ```

2. **Set up watchexec:**
   ```bash
   watchexec -e py python src/pyclarity/tools/new_tool.py
   ```

3. **Follow the stages:**
   - Implement Stage 1 (minimal)
   - Save and watch it run
   - Only proceed to Stage 2 after success
   - Repeat for each stage

### For Debugging Import Errors

1. **Run quick validation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/quick_validate.py
   ```

2. **If imports fail, discover available classes:**
   ```python
   from scripts.discover_imports import discover_module_contents
   discover_module_contents("pyclarity.db.memory_stores")
   ```

3. **Use debug hints from error messages**

### For Continuous Development

1. **Terminal 1 - Main development:**
   ```bash
   watchexec -e py python examples/active_test.py
   ```

2. **Terminal 2 - Quick validation:**
   ```bash
   watchexec -e py python scripts/quick_validate.py
   ```

3. **Terminal 3 - Comprehensive checks (periodic):**
   ```bash
   watch -n 30 python scripts/validate_references.py
   ```

## Key Improvements

### Before (Problem)
- Write 200+ lines without testing
- Missing imports discovered late
- Vague error messages
- Difficult debugging
- Slow iteration cycles

### After (Solution)
- Test every 10-20 lines
- Imports validated upfront
- Rich error context with `loguru`
- Debug hints in every error
- Fast feedback with watchexec

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

These rules should be added to CLAUDE.md's testing section, replacing or augmenting the current "CRITICAL: Testing Requirements" section. The key additions are:

1. Mandatory import validation blocks
2. Loguru configuration and patterns
3. Incremental development stages
4. Watchexec-optimized structure
5. Reference validation tools

## Metrics of Success

When these rules are followed:
- **0 import errors** at runtime
- **< 30 seconds** to detect issues
- **Clear error locations** with file:line:function
- **Actionable debug hints** for every failure
- **90%+ success rate** on first run

## Next Steps

1. Add loguru to project dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv add loguru
   ```

2. Update CLAUDE.md with selected rules

3. Create pre-commit hook for import validation

4. Set up VSCode/Cursor snippets for common patterns

5. Add team documentation for watchexec workflow
