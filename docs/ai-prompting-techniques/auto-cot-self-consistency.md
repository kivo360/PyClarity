# Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency Prompting

Auto-CoT (Automatic Chain of Thought) with Self-Consistency is a technique that generates multiple reasoning chains for a problem, then uses majority voting to select the most reliable answer.

## Core Concept

The technique combines two powerful ideas:
1. **Auto-CoT**: Automatically generates step-by-step reasoning without manual prompting
2. **Self-Consistency**: Creates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most common answer

## Implementation

### Basic Template

```python
def create_self_consistency_prompt(problem, num_chains=5):
    return f"""
    Solve the following problem using {num_chains} independent chains of thought.
    After generating all chains, identify the most common answer through majority voting.
    
    Problem: {problem}
    
    Format your response as:
    1. Chain 1: [reasoning steps] → Answer: [answer]
    2. Chain 2: [reasoning steps] → Answer: [answer]
    ...
    
    Voted Answer: [most common answer]
    Confidence: [percentage of chains agreeing]
    """
```

### Expected Output Structure

```json
{
  "chains": [
    {
      "chain_id": 1,
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Analyze requirements... Step 2: Consider constraints...",
      "answer": "Solution A"
    },
    {
      "chain_id": 2,
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Break down problem... Step 2: Evaluate options...",
      "answer": "Solution A"
    },
    {
      "chain_id": 3,
      "reasoning": "Step 1: Different approach... Step 2: Alternative analysis...",
      "answer": "Solution B"
    }
  ],
  "voted_answer": "Solution A",
  "confidence": 0.67,
  "vote_distribution": {
    "Solution A": 2,
    "Solution B": 1
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Complex Decision Making
```python
problem = """
Should we migrate our monolithic application to microservices?
Consider: team size (15 devs), current performance issues, 
deployment frequency (weekly), and technical debt.
"""
result = apply_self_consistency(problem, num_chains=5)
```

### 2. Mathematical Problem Solving
```python
problem = """
A company's revenue grew by 20% in Q1, decreased by 15% in Q2, 
grew by 25% in Q3, and decreased by 10% in Q4. 
What was the overall growth rate for the year?
"""
result = apply_self_consistency(problem, num_chains=5)
```

### 3. Strategic Analysis
```python
problem = """
Evaluate the viability of launching a freemium SaaS product 
in the project management space. Consider market saturation,
differentiation opportunities, and monetization potential.
"""
result = apply_self_consistency(problem, num_chains=7)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Appropriate Chain Count
```python
def determine_chain_count(problem_complexity):
    """
    More chains for higher complexity problems
    """
    if problem_complexity == "simple":
        return 3
    elif problem_complexity == "medium":
        return 5
    elif problem_complexity == "complex":
        return 7
    else:
        return 5  # default
```

### 2. Encourage Diverse Reasoning
```python
def create_diverse_chains_prompt(problem, num_chains=5):
    diversity_hints = [
        "Consider the problem from a cost perspective",
        "Think about long-term implications",
        "Analyze from a user experience angle",
        "Evaluate technical feasibility",
        "Consider market dynamics"
    ]
    
    return f"""
    Solve this problem with {num_chains} different reasoning approaches:
    {problem}
    
    For each chain, use a different perspective:
    {chr(10).join(f'Chain {i+1}: {hint}' for i, hint in enumerate(diversity_hints[:num_chains]))}
    """
```

### 3. Handle Ties Effectively
```python
def handle_voting_ties(vote_distribution):
    """
    Strategy for handling tied votes
    """
    max_votes = max(vote_distribution.values())
    tied_solutions = [k for k, v in vote_distribution.items() if v == max_votes]
    
    if len(tied_solutions) > 1:
        # Additional criteria for tie-breaking
        return {
            "result": "tie",
            "tied_solutions": tied_solutions,
            "recommendation": "Generate additional chains or apply secondary criteria"
        }
    
    return tied_solutions[0]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Weighted Voting
```python
def weighted_self_consistency(problem, num_chains=5):
    """
    Weight votes based on reasoning quality
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Solve this problem with {num_chains} chains of thought:
    {problem}
    
    For each chain, also provide:
    - Confidence score (0-1)
    - Reasoning quality indicators
    - Key assumptions made
    
    Weight the final vote by confidence scores.
    """
    return prompt
```

### 2. Chain Quality Assessment
```python
def assess_chain_quality(chain):
    """
    Evaluate the quality of each reasoning chain
    """
    quality_metrics = {
        "logical_consistency": check_logical_flow(chain),
        "completeness": check_all_aspects_covered(chain),
        "evidence_based": check_supporting_evidence(chain),
        "clarity": check_reasoning_clarity(chain)
    }
    
    return sum(quality_metrics.values()) / len(quality_metrics)
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
```python
def iterative_self_consistency(problem, initial_chains=5, max_iterations=3):
    """
    Refine answer through multiple rounds if confidence is low
    """
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        result = apply_self_consistency(problem, num_chains=initial_chains)
        
        if result["confidence"] >= 0.8:
            return result
        
        # Add more chains in next iteration
        initial_chains += 2
        problem = f"{problem}\nPrevious analysis showed: {result['vote_distribution']}"
    
    return result
```

## Common Patterns

### Decision Making Pattern
```python
chains = [
    "Economic analysis → Cost-benefit → Decision",
    "Risk assessment → Mitigation strategies → Decision",
    "Stakeholder impact → Alignment check → Decision",
    "Technical feasibility → Implementation plan → Decision",
    "Market analysis → Competitive position → Decision"
]
```

### Problem Solving Pattern
```python
chains = [
    "Break down → Analyze parts → Synthesize solution",
    "Pattern recognition → Apply known solutions → Adapt",
    "First principles → Build up → Validate solution",
    "Constraint analysis → Optimize → Solution",
    "Reverse engineering → Work backwards → Solution"
]
```

### Analysis Pattern
```python
chains = [
    "Quantitative metrics → Statistical analysis → Conclusion",
    "Qualitative factors → Thematic analysis → Conclusion",
    "Historical context → Trend analysis → Conclusion",
    "Comparative analysis → Benchmarking → Conclusion",
    "Systems thinking → Interconnections → Conclusion"
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All chains converge too quickly
**Solution**: Encourage diversity
```python
prompt += "\nEnsure each chain uses a distinctly different approach or framework."
```

### Issue: Highly divergent answers
**Solution**: Add grounding constraints
```python
prompt += "\nGround each chain in the provided data and constraints."
```

### Issue: Low confidence scores
**Solution**: Increase chain count or add expert perspectives
```python
if confidence < 0.6:
    additional_chains = generate_expert_chains(problem, num_experts=3)
```

    """
    Generate all chains concurrently for speed
    """
    tasks = [
        generate_single_chain(problem, chain_id) 
        for chain_id in range(num_chains)
    ]
    chains = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return chains
```

### 2. Caching Common Patterns
```python
def cache_reasoning_patterns(problem_type):
    """
    Cache successful reasoning patterns for reuse
    """
    pattern_cache = {
        "technical_decision": ["feasibility", "cost", "risk", "timeline"],
        "business_strategy": ["market", "competition", "resources", "growth"],
        "product_design": ["user_needs", "technical", "business", "design"]
    }
    return pattern_cache.get(problem_type, [])
```

### 3. Early Stopping
```python
def early_stopping_self_consistency(problem, min_chains=3, max_chains=7):
    """
    Stop generating chains if high confidence achieved early
    """
    chains = []
    for i in range(max_chains):
        chain = generate_single_chain(problem, i)
        chains.append(chain)
        
        if i >= min_chains - 1:
            confidence = calculate_vote_confidence(chains)
            if confidence >= 0.9:
                break
    
    return process_chains(chains)
```

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Benchmark Problems
```python
benchmark_problems = [
    {
        "problem": "Classic logic puzzle",
        "expected_confidence": 0.9,
        "known_answer": "Solution X"
    },
    {
        "problem": "Business case analysis",
        "expected_confidence": 0.7,
        "acceptable_answers": ["Option A", "Option B"]
    }
]
```

### 2. Quality Metrics
```python
def evaluate_self_consistency_quality(result):
    metrics = {
        "answer_clarity": len(result["voted_answer"]) > 0,
        "confidence_threshold": result["confidence"] >= 0.6,
        "chain_diversity": calculate_diversity(result["chains"]),
        "reasoning_quality": average_chain_quality(result["chains"])
    }
    return metrics
```

## Conclusion

Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency dramatically improves reasoning reliability by:
- Exploring multiple solution paths
- Building consensus through voting
- Quantifying confidence in answers
- Reducing single-chain errors

When combined with Visual Chain-of-Thought and Dynamic Prompt Rewriting, it creates a robust system for complex problem-solving and decision-making.
