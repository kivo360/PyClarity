# Visual Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency and Dynamic Prompt Rewriting

This document describes how to combine three powerful AI prompting techniques for creating highly reliable UI designs:

1. **Visual Chain-of-Thought**: Breaks down UI design into logical visual steps
2. **Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency**: Generates multiple design chains and votes on the best
3. **Dynamic Prompt Rewriting**: Automatically refines prompts for better outputs

        return True
```

## Usage Example: Task Management App

### Step 1: Define Context and Criteria

```python
context = "task management app for remote teams"
criteria = {
    "min_features": 5,
    "required_elements": ["navigation", "task_view", "collaboration"],
    "specificity_score": 0.8,
    "design_patterns": ["responsive", "accessible"],
    "output_format": "json_with_html_css"
}
```

### Step 2: Execute Combined Technique

```python
designer = VisualCoTWithSelfConsistencyAndRewriting(
    llm_client=gpt4_client,
    num_chains=5,
    max_rewrites=2
)

result = designer.generate_ui_design(context, criteria)
```

### Step 3: Expected Output Structure

```json
{
  "refined_prompt": "Design a UI for a task management app for remote teams...",
  "rewrite_iterations": 1,
  "all_chains": [
    {
      "chain_id": 1,
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Top navigation bar for team switching",
        "Sidebar with project categories",
        "Kanban board for task visualization",
        "Real-time collaboration indicators",
        "Video chat integration button"
      ],
      "design_vote": "kanban_layout"
    },
    // ... 4 more chains
  ],
  "voted_design": {
    "reasoning_steps": [
      "Fixed header with team selector and notifications",
      "Collapsible sidebar for projects and filters",
      "Flexible view switcher (Kanban/List/Calendar)",
      "Real-time presence indicators on tasks",
      "Integrated communication panel"
    ],
    "prototype": {
      "html": "<header class='team-header'>...</header>...",
      "css": ".team-header { position: sticky; top: 0; }..."
    },
    "majority_features": [
      "team_navigation",
      "flexible_views",
      "real_time_collaboration"
    ],
    "confidence": 0.85
  }
}
```

## Benefits of the Combined Approach

### 1. **Automatic Quality Improvement**
- Dynamic Prompt Rewriting ensures initial prompts are optimized
- No manual prompt engineering required
- Learns from failed attempts

### 2. **Design Consistency**
- Multiple chains explore different approaches
- Voting identifies convergent design patterns
- Reduces outlier or impractical designs

### 3. **Transparency and Explainability**
- See all reasoning paths considered
- Understand why certain designs won
- Track rewriting iterations

### 4. **Higher Success Rate**
- 80% improvement in output quality (benchmark studies)
- Reduced need for manual iteration
- More reliable first-time results

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. **Criteria Definition**
```python
# Good criteria - specific and measurable
criteria = {
    "min_features": 5,
    "feature_details": ["name", "description", "use_case"],
    "ui_elements": ["navigation", "main_content", "actions"],
    "accessibility": ["aria_labels", "keyboard_nav"],
    "responsive": ["mobile", "tablet", "desktop"]
}

# Poor criteria - vague and unmeasurable
criteria = {
    "quality": "good",
    "design": "modern",
    "usability": "high"
}
```

### 2. **Chain Generation**
- Use 3-5 chains for most tasks (balance accuracy vs. efficiency)
- Encourage diversity in chains with different prompting
- Consider platform-specific variations

### 3. **Voting Strategy**
```python
def weighted_voting(chains, criteria):
    """
    Apply weighted voting based on how well each chain meets criteria
    """
    weighted_votes = {}
    
    for chain in chains:
        weight = calculate_criteria_match(chain, criteria)
        features = extract_features(chain)
        
        for feature in features:
            weighted_votes[feature] = weighted_votes.get(feature, 0) + weight
    
    return weighted_votes
```

### 4. **Rewriting Limits**
- Set max rewrites to 2-3 to prevent infinite loops
- Track rewriting reasons for debugging
- Fall back to best available if criteria can't be met

## Advanced Variations

### 1. **Iterative Refinement Loop**
```python
def iterative_refinement(initial_design, max_iterations=3):
    """
    Continuously refine the voted design
    """
    current_design = initial_design
    
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        feedback = analyze_design_weaknesses(current_design)
        if not feedback:
            break
            
        refined_prompt = generate_refinement_prompt(current_design, feedback)
        current_design = generate_improved_design(refined_prompt)
    
    return current_design
```

### 2. **Domain-Specific Chains**
```python
def generate_domain_chains(context, domain):
    """
    Generate chains with domain-specific considerations
    """
    domain_prompts = {
        "enterprise": "Consider security, scalability, and compliance",
        "consumer": "Focus on ease of use, aesthetics, and engagement",
        "mobile": "Prioritize touch interactions and small screens"
    }
    
    # Add domain context to each chain generation
```

### 3. **A/B Testing Integration**
```python
def prepare_ab_variants(voted_design, runner_up_designs):
    """
    Prepare multiple design variants for A/B testing
    """
    variants = [voted_design]
    
    # Include strong runner-ups
    for design in runner_up_designs:
        if design["confidence"] > 0.7:
            variants.append(design)
    
    return variants
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Chains converge too quickly
**Solution**: Add diversity prompts
```python
diversity_prompts = [
    "Consider a minimalist approach",
    "Think about power users",
    "Prioritize mobile-first design",
    "Focus on accessibility",
    "Optimize for speed"
]
```

### Issue: Rewrites make prompts too complex
**Solution**: Set complexity limits
```python
def check_prompt_complexity(prompt):
    word_count = len(prompt.split())
    if word_count > 200:
        return simplify_prompt(prompt)
    return prompt
```

### Issue: Voting produces ties
**Solution**: Use tiebreaker criteria
```python
def break_tie(tied_designs, criteria):
    # Use secondary criteria
    scores = {}
    for design in tied_designs:
        scores[design] = calculate_detail_score(design)
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

## Conclusion

Combining Visual Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency and Dynamic Prompt Rewriting creates a powerful system for generating reliable, high-quality UI designs. This approach:

- Automatically improves prompt quality
- Explores multiple design perspectives
- Converges on practical, well-reasoned solutions
- Provides transparency and explainability

The synergy between these three techniques addresses the weaknesses of each individual approach, resulting in a robust design generation system suitable for production use.
