# Extended Copywriting Frameworks Library

This document contains additional copywriting frameworks with TypeDict definitions for structured I/O and Jinja2 template integration.

## Framework Type Definitions

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Optional, Dict, Any

# Base types for all frameworks
class FrameworkInput(TypedDict, total=False):
    """Base input structure for all frameworks"""
    product_service: str
