# AI Prompting Techniques for PyClarity

This directory contains documentation for advanced AI prompting techniques that can enhance PyClarity's cognitive tools and capabilities.

## Techniques Overview

### 1. Visual Chain-of-Thought (Visual CoT)
**Purpose**: Design intuitive UI interfaces by breaking down visual reasoning into logical steps.

**Key Features**:
- Multimodal reasoning for UI/UX design
- Step-by-step visual logic before code generation
- JSON output with reasoning steps and HTML/CSS prototypes

**Best For**: UI design, visual prototyping, interface planning

### 2. Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency
**Purpose**: Generate multiple reasoning chains and use majority voting for reliable answers.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple independent reasoning paths (3-5 chains)
- Majority voting for final answer selection
- 80% accuracy improvement in complex tasks

**Best For**: Complex reasoning, decision-making, high-stakes analysis

### 3. Dynamic Prompt Rewriting
**Purpose**: Automatically refine prompts to improve output quality.

**Key Features**:
- Self-evaluation of outputs
- Automatic prompt revision
- Iterative improvement until criteria are met

**Best For**: Iterative development, precise requirements, quality assurance

## Combined Implementation

The most powerful approach combines all three techniques:

1. **Dynamic Prompt Rewriting** refines the initial prompt
2. **Visual Chain-of-Thought** generates UI design steps
3. **Self-Consistency** creates multiple design chains and votes

See [visual-cot-self-consistency-dynamic-rewriting.md](./visual-cot-self-consistency-dynamic-rewriting.md) for detailed implementation.

## Integration with PyClarity

These techniques can enhance PyClarity's cognitive tools:

### Strategic Decision Accelerator
- Use Self-Consistency for multiple strategic perspectives
- Apply Dynamic Rewriting to refine decision criteria

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
- Generate diverse viewpoints with Visual CoT chains
- Vote on consensus using Self-Consistency

### Iterative Validation Framework
- Dynamic Rewriting for continuous improvement
- Self-Consistency for validation reliability

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up multimodal LLM integration (GPT-4o, Claude 3, or Grok 3)
- [ ] Create prompt template structure for visual reasoning steps
- [ ] Implement JSON output formatting with reasoning steps and code
- [ ] Build HTML/CSS code generation from visual steps
- [ ] Create UI preview/validation system
- [ ] Implement Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency for Visual Chain-of-Thought
- [ ] Build majority voting system for UI designs
- [ ] Create multi-chain generation system (3-5 design chains)
- [ ] Integrate Dynamic Prompt Rewriting for automatic refinement

## Quick Start Examples

### Visual Chain-of-Thought
```python
prompt = """
Design a UI for a task management app. 
Use visual chain-of-thought to describe 5 layout steps.
Output as JSON with reasoning_steps and prototype.
"""
```

### Auto-CoT with Self-Consistency
```python
prompt = """
Solve this problem with 5 chains of thought, 
then majority-vote the final answer.
Problem: [your complex problem here]
"""
```

### Dynamic Prompt Rewriting
```python
prompt = """
Generate a feature list for an AI web tool.
If output lacks specificity, rewrite the prompt 
with clearer criteria and regenerate.
"""
```
