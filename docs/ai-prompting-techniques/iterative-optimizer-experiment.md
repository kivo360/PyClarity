# Iterative Optimizer Experiment

## ðŸŽ¯ Experiment Goals

### Primary Goal
Create a self-improving loop that generates, evaluates, and refines a feature list for our AI prompting framework.

### Decomposed Sub-Goals

1. **Document Processing Goals**
   - Successfully chunk all documentation using chonkie
   - Create searchable index of all content
   - Generate hierarchical summaries (doc â†’ section â†’ paragraph)
   - Extract key concepts and relationships

2. **Feature Generation Goals**
   - Generate initial feature list from documentation
   - Categorize features by priority and complexity
   - Identify feature dependencies
   - Map features to user needs

3. **Optimization Loop Goals**
   - Improve feature descriptions with each iteration
   - Discover missing features through gap analysis
   - Refine feature priorities based on patterns
   - Converge on optimal feature set

# Pseudocode for the iterative optimizer

class FeatureOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.iteration = 0
        self.feature_list = []
        self.improvement_history = []
        self.convergence_threshold = 0.95

            summary = self.generate_summary(index)
            
            # Step 2: Generate/refine features
            new_features = self.generate_features(summary)

            self.save_checkpoint()

        Iteration: {self.iteration}
        
        Generate an improved feature list that:
        1. Addresses gaps in current features
        2. Refines existing feature descriptions
        3. Adds newly discovered requirements
        4. Removes redundant or low-value features

```

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare against documentation coverage
   - Check for missing user scenarios
   - Identify technical requirements gaps

2. **Redundancy Elimination**
   - Merge similar features
   - Remove duplicate functionality
   - Consolidate related items

3. **Priority Refinement**
   - Adjust based on dependency chains
   - Consider implementation complexity
   - Factor in user value scores

4. **Description Enhancement**
   - Clarify ambiguous features
   - Add acceptance criteria
   - Include technical specifications

    "coherence_score": 0.0      # How well features work together

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Outcomes

1. **Iteration 1-5**: Rough feature list, many gaps
2. **Iteration 6-20**: Rapid improvement, feature discovery
3. **Iteration 21-50**: Refinement, priority adjustments
4. **Iteration 51+**: Convergence, minor tweaks only

This experiment will give us a data-driven, continuously improving feature list that evolves based on our comprehensive documentation.
