Feature: Product Discovery Pipeline
  As an entrepreneur or product developer
  I want to analyze persona data to discover product opportunities
  So that I can build products that solve real problems

  Background:
    Given the Product Discovery Pipeline is available
    And I have collected persona research data
    And all required cognitive tools are accessible

  Scenario: End-to-end product discovery
    Given I have persona data for:
      | name      | role              | pain_points                          |
      | Sarah     | Marketing Manager | Tool fragmentation, Manual reporting |
      | Marcus    | Small Business    | Inventory management, Limited time   |
      | Elena     | Freelancer        | Client tracking, Invoice management  |
    When I execute the product discovery pipeline
    Then the pipeline should complete all 9 stages:
      | stage                      | expected_output                      |
      | persona_analysis          | Structured insights per persona       |
      | pain_point_extraction     | Clustered pain points                |
      | idea_generation           | Product ideas addressing pain points  |
      | multi_perspective_validation | Validation from multiple angles    |
      | market_analysis           | TAM, SAM, SOM estimates              |
      | competitive_intelligence  | Competitor landscape                  |
      | feature_validation        | Feature-persona fit scores            |
      | usp_generation           | Unique selling propositions           |
      | model_optimization       | Optimized product models              |
    And I should receive at least one OptimizedProductModel

  Scenario: Pain point clustering
    Given these personas have overlapping pain points:
      | persona   | pain_points                                    |
      | Developer | Debugging time, Documentation, Tool switching  |
      | Designer  | Asset management, Tool switching, Collaboration |
      | PM        | Status tracking, Tool switching, Reporting      |
    When the pipeline extracts pain points
    Then "Tool switching" should be identified as a common cluster
    And the cluster should show it affects all 3 personas
    And severity score should be high due to frequency

  Scenario: Idea generation quality
    Given pain point clusters have been identified:
      | cluster                  | severity | frequency | personas_affected |
      | Manual data entry       | 0.8      | 0.9       | 5                |
      | Integration complexity  | 0.9      | 0.7       | 3                |
      | Real-time insights      | 0.7      | 0.8       | 4                |
    When the pipeline generates product ideas
    Then each idea should:
      | requirement                                    |
      | Address at least one pain point cluster       |
      | Include a clear value proposition             |
      | Have feasibility score between 0 and 1        |
      | Specify target user segments                  |
      | Describe the core problem it solves           |

  Scenario: Market viability assessment
    Given a product idea "AI-powered workflow automation"
    When the pipeline performs market analysis
    Then the analysis should include:
      | component         | description                              |
      | Market size      | TAM with reasonable estimates            |
      | Growth potential | Based on market trends                   |
      | Entry barriers   | Technical, financial, regulatory         |
      | Target segments  | Primary and secondary markets            |
    And TAM ≥ SAM ≥ SOM relationship should hold

  Scenario: Competitive intelligence insights
    Given the product space has known competitors:
      | competitor    | market_position | key_strength        |
      | Zapier       | Leader          | Integration breadth |
      | Make         | Challenger      | Visual workflows    |
      | n8n          | Nicher          | Self-hosted option  |
    When competitive analysis runs
    Then the system should identify:
      | insight_type              | example                           |
      | Differentiation opportunities | Gaps in current solutions      |
      | Competitive advantages    | Our unique capabilities           |
      | Market positioning       | Where we can win                   |
      | Risks and threats        | Competitive responses              |

  Scenario: Feature validation with personas
    Given product features have been proposed:
      | feature                | description                          |
      | Visual workflow builder| Drag-and-drop interface             |
      | API marketplace       | Pre-built integrations               |
      | Team collaboration    | Real-time editing and comments       |
    When validating against personas
    Then each feature should be scored for:
      | validation_aspect    | measurement                         |
      | Persona fit         | How well it addresses their needs   |
      | Usage frequency     | How often they'd use it             |
      | Value perception    | Willingness to pay                  |
      | Learning curve      | Ease of adoption                    |

  Scenario: USP generation and selection
    Given validated features and market analysis
    When generating unique selling propositions
    Then each USP should:
      | requirement                                    |
      | Be concise and memorable                      |
      | Differentiate from competitors                |
      | Resonate with target personas                 |
      | Be defensible and sustainable                 |
      | Include proof points                          |
    And the best USP should have effectiveness score > 0.7

  Scenario: Optimized model validation
    Given the pipeline has completed all stages
    When I receive the OptimizedProductModel
    Then it should contain:
      | component              | validation                           |
      | product_name          | Clear and marketable                 |
      | target_personas       | Mapped to original research          |
      | core_features         | Validated against pain points        |
      | business_model        | Specific (SaaS, marketplace, etc)    |
      | go_to_market_strategy | Actionable steps                     |
      | success_metrics       | Measurable KPIs                      |
      | risk_factors          | Identified and mitigation planned    |
    And confidence score should reflect analysis quality

  Scenario: Pipeline failure recovery
    Given a stage fails during execution
    When the pipeline encounters an error in "market_analysis"
    Then the pipeline should:
      | action                                         |
      | Log the specific error                        |
      | Attempt to continue with available data       |
      | Mark affected analyses as "partial"           |
      | Still produce results from completed stages   |
      | Include error context in final output         |

  Scenario: Empty results handling
    Given personas with vague or minimal pain points
    When the pipeline cannot generate viable ideas
    Then it should:
      | response                                       |
      | Explain why no ideas were generated          |
      | Suggest gathering more persona data           |
      | Provide guidance on better research methods   |
      | Not return empty or placeholder results       |
