Feature: Cognitive Tool Workflow Orchestration
  As a product developer or AI agent
  I want to chain cognitive tools together in workflows
  So that I can perform comprehensive analysis through structured reasoning patterns

  Background:
    Given PyClarity MCP server is running
    And All cognitive tools are available
    And Workflow engine is initialized as FastMCP client

  # Human Consumer Scenarios
  
  Scenario: Solo entrepreneur chains tools for product validation
    Given I have a product concept "AI-powered fitness tracking for remote workers"
    When I execute a workflow with Sequential Thinking → Mental Models → Decision Framework
    Then Sequential Thinking breaks down the concept into logical steps
    And Mental Models applies different business frameworks to analyze viability
    And Decision Framework evaluates options using weighted criteria
    And Results flow seamlessly between each tool
    And I receive a comprehensive analysis within 30 seconds
    And The analysis includes confidence scores and reasoning chains

  Scenario: Product manager orchestrates parallel competitive analysis
    Given I need to analyze multiple competitors simultaneously
    And I have identified competitors: ["Competitor A", "Competitor B", "Competitor C"]
    When I execute parallel workflows for each competitor
    Then Each competitor analysis runs independently
    And Mental Models analyzes each competitor's business model
    And Impact Propagation traces market effects
    And All analyses complete within 20 seconds
    And Results are synthesized into comparative insights

  Scenario: Technical lead validates feature with multi-perspective analysis
    Given I have a feature proposal "Real-time collaboration in code editor"
    When I execute Multi-Perspective Analysis with technical, user, and business views
    Then Technical perspective evaluates implementation complexity
    And User perspective assesses usability and demand
    And Business perspective analyzes ROI and market fit
    And Triple Constraint optimizer balances scope, time, and resources
    And I receive actionable recommendations with trade-off analysis

  # Agent Consumer Scenarios

  Scenario: AI agent requests sequential cognitive analysis
    Given An AI agent needs to analyze a product decision
    When The agent calls workflow API with Sequential Thinking → Scientific Method
    Then The workflow engine accepts the request with correlation ID
    And Sequential Thinking completes first with structured steps
    And Scientific Method receives Sequential Thinking output as input
    And The agent receives structured JSON response
    And Response includes execution metadata and timing information

  Scenario: Development agent orchestrates BDD generation workflow
    Given A development agent has validated product features
    When The agent requests BDD generation workflow
    Then Collaborative Reasoning generates user personas
    And Sequential Thinking maps user journeys
    And Structured Argumentation creates acceptance criteria
    And The agent receives Gherkin scenarios for each feature
    And Scenarios include both human and agent test cases

  # Error Handling and Recovery

  Scenario: Workflow handles tool failure gracefully
    Given I have a workflow with Tool A → Tool B → Tool C
    When Tool B fails during execution
    Then The workflow captures the error details
    And Previous results from Tool A are preserved
    And The workflow attempts retry with exponential backoff
    And If retry fails, workflow returns partial results
    And Error report includes recovery suggestions

  Scenario: Circular dependency detection
    Given I define a workflow where Tool A depends on Tool B
    And Tool B depends on Tool C
    And Tool C depends on Tool A
    When I attempt to execute this workflow
    Then The workflow engine detects the circular dependency
    And Returns an error before execution starts
    And Suggests alternative workflow arrangements

  # Performance and Scalability

  Scenario: Workflow executes within performance constraints
    Given I have a complex workflow with 10 cognitive tools
    And 5 tools can run in parallel
    And 5 tools have sequential dependencies
    When I execute the workflow
    Then Parallel tools complete within 10 seconds
    And Sequential tools complete within 15 seconds total
    And Total workflow execution time is under 25 seconds
    And Memory usage stays below 500MB

  Scenario: Workflow state persistence and recovery
    Given I have a long-running workflow in progress
    When The workflow engine crashes after completing 3 of 5 tools
    Then The workflow state is persisted
    And Upon restart, the workflow resumes from tool 4
    And Previously completed results are not re-executed
    And The workflow completes successfully

  # Workflow Configuration and Discovery

  Scenario: Dynamic workflow creation from configuration
    Given I have a YAML workflow configuration
    """
    name: product-discovery
    tools:
      - name: sequential_thinking
        config:
          max_depth: 3
      - name: mental_models
        depends_on: [sequential_thinking]
        config:
          models: [lean_startup, jobs_to_be_done]
      - name: decision_framework
        depends_on: [mental_models]
    """
    When I load and execute this workflow
    Then The workflow engine parses the configuration
    And Resolves tool dependencies automatically
    And Executes tools in correct order
    And Applies tool-specific configurations

  Scenario: Workflow template library usage
    Given PyClarity provides workflow templates
    When I request the "product-validation" template
    Then I receive a pre-configured workflow
    And The workflow includes appropriate cognitive tools
    And I can customize the template parameters
    And The customized workflow executes successfully
