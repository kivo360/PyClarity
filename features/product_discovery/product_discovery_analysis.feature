Feature: Product Discovery Cognitive Analysis
  As a product developer or entrepreneur
  I want to use cognitive tools to analyze product opportunities
  So that I can validate ideas and create optimized business models

  Background:
    Given I have access to PyClarity cognitive tools
    And I have the WorkflowEngine configured
    And I have persona data available

  Scenario: Extract Activities and Pain Points from Personas
    Given I have loaded persona profiles
    When I analyze personas using Sequential Thinking and Collaborative Reasoning
    Then I should extract daily activities for each persona
    And I should identify pain points and frustrations
    And I should categorize pain points by severity and frequency
    And the results should be structured for further analysis

  Scenario: Generate Product Ideas from Pain Points
    Given I have extracted pain points from multiple personas
    When I group personas by similar pain points
    And I apply Strategic Decision Accelerator for ideation
    Then I should receive product ideas addressing those pain points
    And each idea should include title, description, and unique value
    And ideas should be mapped to target persona groups
    And ideas should include feasibility constraints

  Scenario: Multi-Perspective Validation of Ideas
    Given I have generated product ideas
    When I validate ideas using Multi-Perspective Analysis
    Then I should get validation from primary target personas
    And I should get validation from adjacent personas
    And I should get contrarian perspective validation
    And each validation should include feedback, concerns, and opportunities
    And validation scores should guide idea prioritization

  Scenario: Market Analysis Workflow
    Given I have validated product ideas
    When I execute market analysis using Mental Models and Decision Framework
    Then I should receive market size estimation
    And I should identify competitive landscape
    And I should get market entry strategies
    And I should understand regulatory considerations
    And results should inform business model decisions

  Scenario: Competitive Intelligence Analysis
    Given I have a product idea and target market
    When I analyze competitors using Impact Propagation and Decision Framework
    Then I should identify direct and indirect competitors
    And I should understand competitive advantages and weaknesses
    And I should receive positioning recommendations
    And I should get differentiation strategies
    And analysis should include market gap opportunities

  Scenario: Feature Validation with Personas
    Given I have product ideas with proposed features
    When I validate features using persona tools and Multi-Perspective Analysis
    Then I should understand feature importance for each persona
    And I should get feature adoption likelihood scores
    And I should identify must-have vs nice-to-have features
    And I should receive feature complexity assessments
    And validation should guide MVP definition

  Scenario: USP Generation Pipeline
    Given I have validated features and competitive analysis
    When I generate USP using cognitive reasoning chains
    Then I should receive multiple USP options
    And each USP should be clear and compelling
    And USPs should differentiate from competitors
    And USPs should resonate with target personas
    And I should get messaging recommendations

  Scenario: End-to-End Product Discovery
    Given I start with raw persona data
    When I execute the complete product discovery pipeline
    Then I should progress through all analysis stages
    And I should receive optimized product models
    And models should include validated features
    And models should have clear business value
    And results should be ready for BDD scenario generation

  Scenario: Parallel Cognitive Tool Execution
    Given I have multiple analysis tasks
    When I execute independent cognitive tools in parallel
    Then tools should run concurrently where possible
    And results should be aggregated correctly
    And dependencies should be respected
    And performance should improve over sequential execution

  Scenario: Error Handling in Discovery Pipeline
    Given I am running product discovery analysis
    When a cognitive tool fails or returns invalid results
    Then the pipeline should handle errors gracefully
    And failed analyses should be retried with refined inputs
    And partial results should be preserved
    And users should receive clear error feedback
